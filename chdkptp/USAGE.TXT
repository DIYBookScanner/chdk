chdkptp supports console CLI, a GUI, and batch operation.

The GUI is still unfinished

=Invoking=
The interface is selected by command line options, described below.

==Running under linux==
Under linux, the .lua files will not automatically found relative to the
executable directory. You can set LUA_PATH on the command line to allow them
to be located:
$ LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp ...

Similarly, if the IUP and CD shared libraries are not on the default system
path, you must also set LD_LIBARARY_PATH
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/iup LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp -g

It is suggested that you put all this in a shell script, see chdkptp-sample.sh
for an example.

You may need to make permission changes to allow users other than root to open
the USB device. Some notes can be found in this forum post:
http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=6231.msg89252#msg89252

==Command line==
Usage: chdkptp [options]
Options:
 -g  start GUI - default if GUI available and no options given
 -i  start interactive CLI
 -c  connect at startup, with optional device spec e.g. -c"-d001 -bbus-0"
 -e  execute CLI command, multiple allowed, e.g -e"u DISKBOOT.BIN" -ereboot
 -r  specify startup command file, if no file given skip default startup files
 -h  help

If invoked with no options, the GUI will be started if available.  Otherwise,
the CLI will be started.

If started with options and neither -g nor -i is given, chdkptp will run in
batch mode, exiting after performing the actions specified by the options.

When using -e, -c or -r, the values must immediately follow the option, without
any space, e.g. -rmyfile or -r=myfile, not -r myfile. If any arguments that 
include spaces, they must be quoted.

==Startup files==
Startup files can be used to automatically execute CLI commands at startup.
Using the exec command, you may also execute arbitrary lua.

If the -r command line option is used, it is treated as the full name of the
file, and the default files are ignored. If -r is given without a filename,
no startup file is used. 

If -r is not used, CHDKPTP checks for startup files using the CHDKPTP_HOME
environment variable, or if that is not set, the HOME environment variable.

.chdkptprc (linux) / _chdkptprc (windows) is the default startup file in CLI
or batch mode.

.chdkptpguirc (linux) / _chdkptpguirc (windows) is the default startup file
in GUI mode. This is run after the gui module is loaded, but before the GUI
is started.

=CLI=
CLI commands are available from the console, GUI and the command line

Many CLI commands have full descriptive name and a short name. The short 
is listed in parenthesis in the command reference below.

==CLI parsing==
The cli commands lua, luar, exec and putm all accept a single line of free-form
text and pass it unmodified to the underlying function.

Most other commands parse the remaining input into switches and arguments
Switches are in the for -switchname and may take values with -switch=value
Arguments are any other sequence of non-space or quoted characters.

Both switches and words may be quoted as follows:
The characters " or ' can be used to quote arguments or switch values that
contain spaces. Inside double quotes "",  backslash \ is treated as an escape
character.

==Command reference==

==Runtime options==
The set command allows you to set the following runtime options

core_verbose=0       - number: ptp core verbosity

In the GUI, the following additional options are available:
gui_dump_palette=false - boolean: dump live palette data on state change
gui_context_plus=false - boolean: use IUP context plus if available
gui_force_replay_palette=-1 - number: override palette type dump replay, -1 disable
gui_verbose=1        - number: control verbosity of gui

Notes:
1) Setting a gui option when the gui is not running is currently an error
2) gui_context_plus must be set in a startup file to take effect.

==Run a script file on the camera==
The suggested way to run a lua script file on the cameras is

con> .loadfile('A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/MY.LUA')()

loadfile returns a function, the following () executes it immediately.

The reason to loadfile instead of the more obvious dofile() or require() is
that code executed in these functions cannot yield, which means you wouldn't
be able to use sleep or keyboard functions.

If the script was written to be loaded from the CHDK script menu and expects
menu settings, you will need to manually set the corresponding variables, e.g.

con> .a=1; b=2; loadfile("A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/MY.LUA")()

While the script is running you will not be able to control the camera from
chdkptp using the GUI key buttons or any other script commands. You also will
note be able to gracefully terminate the script without physically pressing the
shutter button.

If you want to have a script that runs for a long time on the camera, but still
be able to control it over ptp, you will probably need to write your own script
using the ptp message interface. Some examples of this in the chdkptp lua code
lua/rlibs.lua msg_shell and lua/multicam.lua
