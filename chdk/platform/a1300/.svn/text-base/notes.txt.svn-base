KNOWN BUGS
**********
- GetBatteryTemperature() returns always -99° Celsius or -146° Fahrenheit
- Video Time limit removal is not implemented.
- AF during video recording is disabled.
- Conflicting CHDK shortcuts

For Developers
**************
A1300 and A810 ROM code appears identical, and builds for one camera will run on the other.
However, the builds differ because
 PLATFORMID is different, so PS.FI2 files are not compatible and script would report the wrong value.
Any code changes made to one camera should probably be applied to the other.

- rand() and srand() are not part of original firmware. 
  They were added in platorm/generic/wrappers.c under #ifdef CAM_MISSING_RAND
- AF during video recording is disabled:

- hook_raw_image_addr() & hook_alt_raw_image_addr() return the same value
