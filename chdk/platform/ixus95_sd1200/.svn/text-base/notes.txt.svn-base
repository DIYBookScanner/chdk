General info:

10.0MP raw 3720*2772 12 bits/pixel
Video is h264 NOT mjpeg

With FI2, you must boot in play mode in order to access the firm update menu.

Display:
//Live view is 360x240
//Bitmap buffer is 720x240
//Bitmap color palette is different from other cameras.

Buttons:
To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the Playback [>] button.

Other keys use the standard mapping for cameras without an erase button.

Features known BROKEN or NOT supported:
- Microphone mute/unmute not supported - Audio IC: AK4636
- It is not possible to change to rec mode using chdkptp. It seems to be a bug similar
  to this: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=10664.msg105042#msg105042
- Mode  2598 in firmware but not in current modemap
- Many other things are untested.

Other issues:
//Pressing the shutter quickly with overrides enabled may result in incorrect white
//balance. It may also cause issues if the flash is automatically triggered.
