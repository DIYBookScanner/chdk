This is an alpha port with some serious issues, but the porter(s) neglected to put anything here. Good luck!

The following items appeared on the wiki
--
The video key press short switch the chdk alt mode. press long record video

chdk menu make card bootable does not work. Use a Program on your PC to make the Card bootable. Remember the 4 GB Limit of boot Partition. I suggest to use 2 4 gb Partitions so you need switch partitions only when 4gb is full when you want read data.

Switch partitions chdk menu work. After that switch off and on the Camera

This camera use a #define cam_CFAPattern 0x01020001 // Green red blue Green

bayer pattern. So only DNG RAW work. For cr2 need change the converter to support this pattern
