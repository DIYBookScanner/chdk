S80

- DIGIC II
- has iris
- has no ND filter
- has a "subCPU", therefore it wakes up on USB connection

Current source is based on the source provided by Lionfish, with the following changes:

- several addresses have been corrected (functions, firmware variables)
- jogdial is supported
- no special shortcuts are defined
- DNG works (colors are not calibrated, cropping is based on 1 camera's photos)
- movie mode works (optical zoom, focus override, quality overrides work, af-scan not)
- subject distance override is only available in AF lock or during movie recording
- extra long exposures are available

Issues:

- To start in play mode, press and hold the play [>] button until the camera starts
- CHDK PTP is restricted to play mode, mode switch doesn't work

Developer notes

    Lens cover
     - fully open:      0xc0220094 reads 0x40, 0xc0220204 bit5 = 0
     - not fully open:  0xc0220094 reads 0x41, 0xc0220204 bit5 = 1

    Focus override
     MoveFocusLensToDistance crashes by default, no matter AF, MF, AFL.
        Can be made working by setting a flag (0xb23c, CancelFocusLensMaxSpeedLimit does it),
        BUT using it screws up the focus in MF or AF, only solution is a power cycle.
        Therefore, it's restricted to AFL and movie mode.
        In movie mode, it's only enabled when recording.

    AF scan in video
     Causes assert even in VGA mode, workarounds are futile...
