OTHER ISSUES
************
Folder naming and file counter use a new method, seem to be working but may have issues

subject distance override is only available in AF lock
If using set_aflock from script, you must use set the AF_LOCK propcase to 1

KNOWN BUGS
**********
DNG color matrix is copy+paste from D10
PTP Live view and functions like zebra, histogram do not work correctly in fisheye effect mode
