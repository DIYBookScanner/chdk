For Developers
**************
SX240 and SX260 100c ROM code appears identical, and builds for one camera will run on the other.
However, the builds differ because
 PLATFORMID is different, so PS.FI2 files are not compatible and script would report the wrong value.
 GPS is not present on SX240, and is so is turned off in platform_camera.h
Any code changes made to one camera should probably be applied to the other.
