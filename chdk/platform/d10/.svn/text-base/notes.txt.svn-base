Scripts tested successfully
- llibtst.lua 
- setmode.lua batch mode, including play/rec change
- tstcallf.lua
- romlog.lua
- badpixel.lua
- mdfb digic 3

Known issues:
- DNG has dark borders. This is intentional, the active area covers all pixels that have any data, but there are large areas which have data but are distinct from the normal jpeg area.
- Camera will crash if SD override is used while servo AF is enabled.
