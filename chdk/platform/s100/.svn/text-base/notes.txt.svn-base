S100 NOTES

- Alt shortcut: 
adjustable, default is the play button. Hold for 1/2 second for original function

- This camera is able to boot from FAT32 cards when the appropriate BOOTDISK string is written

- The 'ring func' button is treated as the 'ERASE' button in CHDK shortcuts and scripting.
- The 'video' button is treated as the 'DISP.' button in CHDK shortcuts and scripting.

CAMERA TODO/KNOWN ISSUES:
- manual loading with "firm update" loading crashes (confirmed on 100d and 101a), so PS.FI2 is not included in the autobuild.
