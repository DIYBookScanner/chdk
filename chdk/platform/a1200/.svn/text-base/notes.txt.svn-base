Notes on SD Override for the A1200
==================================
SD overrides will only work when the camera is in AFL mode ( auto focus lock ).   To activate AFL :
1) The camera must be in P mode (on the upper dial) rather than AUTO or SCN.
2) You must be in normal Canon shooting mode (not CHDK <ALT> mode)
3) Press the "left/flower" button after first "half pressing & holding" the shutter release button.

If you complete the above 3 steps correctly,  you should see the Canon software put the letters AFL on
 the upper right edge of the LCD.

Development notes:

1) hook_raw_image_addr() & hook_alt_raw_image_addr() return the same value
2) vid_get_viewport_live_fb() not optimized
3) in platform/a1200/lib.c the vid_get_viewport_xxx functions do not yet adjust for viewport changes
