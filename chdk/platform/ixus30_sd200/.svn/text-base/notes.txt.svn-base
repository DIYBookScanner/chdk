****************************************

Camera depending notes: 

- ixus30_sd200 uses Propset 1 of Properties (see http://tinyurl.com/6zbv9b)
- ixus30_sd200 does NOT have a real IRIS Diaphragm, it only has an ND Filter! 


This port is based on fishpepper's ixus 40 port.

Alpha release 1, 2011-10-14

- most parts of the firmware are identical in ixus 30 and 40
- fun fact: camera recognizes (chdk) raw+jpeg pair (but can't handle it, shows small thumbnail with "raw" written below)

VIDEO
- video quality override is partly supported, in 15 steps total (not fully tested)
  at minimum quality the frames are not as compressed as in other cameras (A410... etc)
- 1G video size limit removed (not tested yet)
- there's no zoom during video
- no afscan in video either, but manual focus works during recording
- no manual exposure control during video

PHOTO
- raw, dng works (dng color profile is simply a copy, not correct)
- control of dark frame subtraction is available
- creation of badpixel.bin doesn't work (the process either fails or creates 0 length file)
- continuous shooting not tested
- overrides are only applied on the actual shooting (no effect on half-shoot, this might cause trouble...)
- iso override seems to work, values under a lower limit (around 50-100 (?)) cause the camera to crash
  "market" ISO seems to be higher than the "true" value
- ND-filter control works
- histogram works
- zebra display is not correct for playback, but works correctly in shooting mode (may be my fault)
- flash override not tested
- shutter speed override works (no extra long exposures yet)
- bracketing not tested
- custom auto ISO not tested
- subject distance override seems to work

GENERAL
- some buffer addresses are not entirely correct (no fast md possible)
- the memory dump debug feature only works with uncached addresses (!), chdk code uses cached addresses...
- the usual romlog stuff doesn't work (some functions are missing)
- the camera's firmware is almost 8MB, last MB seems to contain a second OS (lots of duplicated functions) for debugging
  purposes, I guess
- the firmware only knows ver.req, firmware version lacks the GM prefix
- serious issue with the time() function of the firmware: it counts at about 1/7 speed in chdk.
  worked around in code.
- haven't touched the custom keyboard code of the ixus 40 (aside from porting it)
- can't test the existence of usb remote functionality because of hardware issues on my part ;)
- some enhancements over the original ixus 40 port:
 - (flash) params mystery solved (flash parameters use a slightly different structure)
 - the first parameter for GetParameterData(), SetParameterData() is _exactly_ the parameter number, no need for adding 0x4000
 - the location for the raw hook in capt_seq.c had to be changed, without the change one would get either corrupt jpeg or
   corrupt dng when image size is less than "L" (the condition only affected dng, not raw)
 - dark frame subtraction control
 - video support
  - no zoom during video (missing firmware function)
  - no af-scan in video (missing firmware function)
 - 1G video size limit removed (not tested)
 - simple (and coarse, 15 steps only) quality override support for video (constant quality only)
